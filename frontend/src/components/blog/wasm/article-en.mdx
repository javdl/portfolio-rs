# The journey to excellence

Welcome to my WASM portfolio, a cutting-edge showcase of my work with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and WebAssembly, powered by the [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) framework.

This portfolio is more than just a collection of projects; it reflects my commitment to excellence and innovation in the tech industry.

# Stack

In addition to Leptos I have used [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) to create a microservice which uses [RedisDB](https://redis.io/) for persistence. I use the API for some web features like visits or feedback.

# Design

Inspired by the achievements of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Nio](https://www.nio.com/), [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/), [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), and [Nothing](https://nothing.tech/), with [Guille](https://twitter.com/gzmoreira/) as a role model for Latin Americans in software development, I strive for top-tier standards.

Explore sections currently under development, exemplifying quality and precision. Every element is thoughtfully curated to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing digital space. Though some parts are still in progress, I am excited to share this journey with you.

# Features

### Enhanced Performance with SSR & Hydration
  - Lightning-fast initial page loads through server-side rendering.
  - Seamless transition to interactive content with client-side hydration.
  - Optimized for both speed and user interaction.

### Interactive Feedback System
  - Clean, intuitive feedback interface.
  - Real-time email notifications via RedisDB and SMTP.
  - Streamlined user engagement process.

### Advanced Analytics & Insights
  - Individual post view tracking.
  - Centralized visitor analytics in RedisDB.
  - Visual engagement metrics dashboard.

# Monitoring

As I show in the graph above, I have used [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) (another wonderful project powered by Rust) for monitoring. For those who do not know these technologies, InfluxDB is a timeseries database that has its own system for data collection and Grafana serves as a client for this data. In addition, InfluxDB has an alert system that I have connected to a Telegram bot to keep up to date with any incidents.

# Deployment

I have deployed the entire portfolio and the various technologies around it on my own beloved mini server.

The thrill of technological success is palpable. After working tirelessly, I have launched my portfolio and the entire technological environment surrounding it on my own server, a true palace of innovation:

| Component | Name |
|-----------|------|
| **OS** | Fedora Server 40 |
| **HTTPS Server** | Caddy |
| **Domain** | SquareSpace |
| **Administration** | Cockpit and SSH |
| **Monitoring** | Grafana with InfluxDB |
| **Alerts** | InfluxDB with Telegram |

# See you soon

Making this portfolio has been a beautiful adventure, to get to know the WASM world and to reinforce my knowledge in Rust, I dedicate it to my beautiful daughter Sofia, source of my strength and eternal inspiration!
